# Payload Form Builder Plugin

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder)

A plugin for [Payload CMS](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload) to easily allow your admin editors to build and manage forms from the admin panel.

Core features:

- Creates a `forms` collection where you can:
  - Build dynamic forms with any number of fields
  - Add payment fields that can handle dynamic prices
  - Build completely custom and dynamic emails
- Creates a `formSubmissions` collection that:
  - Validates and saves the form data submitted by your frontend
  - Sends emails (if applicable)
  - Handles payment processing (if applicable)

## Installation

```bash
  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-form-builder
  # OR
  npm i @payloadcms/plugin-form-builder
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):

```js
import { buildConfig } from "payload/config";
import formBuilder from "@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder";

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      slug: "pages",
      fields: [],
    },
  ],
  plugins: [formBuilder()],
});

export default config;
```

### Options

- `fields`

  An object of field types to allow your admin editors to build forms with. To override default settings pass either a boolean value or a partial [Payload Block](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks#block-configs) keyed to the block slug. See [Fields](#fields) for more details.

  ```js
  fields: {
    text: true,
    textarea: true,
    select: true,
    email: true,
    state: true,
    country: true,
    checkbox: true,
    number: true,
    message: true,
    payment: false
  }
  ```

- `redirectRelationships`

  An array of collection slugs that, when enabled, are populated as options in form redirect fields.

  ```js
  redirectRelationships: ["pages"];
  ```

- `handlePayment`

  A [beforeChange](<[beforeChange](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/globals#beforechange)>) hook that is called upon form submissions. You can integrate into any third-party payment processing API here. There is a `getPaymentTotal` function that will calculate the total cost after all conditions have been applied.

  ```js
  import { getPaymentTotal } from '@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder';
  ...
  handlePayment: async ({ form, submissionData }) => {
    // first calculate the price
    const paymentField =  form.fields?.find((field) => field.blockType === 'payment');
    const price = getPaymentTotal({
      basePrice: paymentField.basePrice,
      priceConditions: paymentField.priceConditions,
      fieldValues: submissionData,
    });
    // then asynchronously process the payment here
  }
  ```

- `beforeEmail`

  A [beforeChange](<[beforeChange](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/globals#beforechange)>) hook that is called just after emails are prepared, but before they are sent. This is a great place to inject your own HTML template to add custom styles.

  ```js
  beforeEmail: (emailsToSend) => {
    // modify the emails in any way before they are sent
    return emails.map((email) => ({
      ...email,
      html: email.html, // transform the html in any way you'd like (maybe wrap it in an html template?)
    }));
  };
  ```

- `formOverrides`

  Override anything on the form collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections). Your overrides will be merged into the default `forms` collection.

  ```ts
  formOverrides: {
    slug: "contact-forms",
    access: {
      read: () => true,
      update: () => false,
    },
    fields: [
      {
        name: "custom-field",
        type: "text"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- `formSubmissionOverrides`

  By default, this plugin relies on [Payload access control](https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/collections) to restrict the `update` and `read` operations. This is because anyone should be able to create a form submission, even from a public-facing website - but no one should be able to update a submission one it has been created, or read a submission unless they have permission.

  You can override access control and anything else on the form submission collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections). Your overrides will be merged into the default `formSubmissions` collection.

  ```js
  formSubmissionOverrides: {
    slug: "leads",
  }
  ```

## Fields

Each field represents a form input. To override default settings pass either a boolean value or a partial [Payload Block](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks) _keyed to the block's slug_. See [Field Overrides](#field-overrides) for more details on how to do this.

> NOTE: "fields" here are in reference to the _fields to build forms with_, not to be confused with the _fields of a collection_ which are set via `formOverrides.fields`.

- `text`
  - `name`: string
  - `label`: string
  - `defaultValue`: string
  - `width`: string
  - `required`: checkbox
- `textarea`
  - `name`: string
  - `label`: string

    - `fieldToUse`: relationship, dynamically populated based on the fields in your form
    - `condition`: string - `equals`, `notEquals` | `hasValue`
    - `valueForOperator`: string - only if `condition` is `equals` or `notEquals`
    - `operator`: string - `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`
    - `valueType`: string - `static`, `valueOfField`
    - `value`: string - only if `valueType` is `static`

  ### Field Overrides

  You can also provide your own custom field definitions by passing a new [Payload Block](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks#block-configs) object into `fields`. You can override or extend any existing fields by first importing the `fields` from the plugin:

  ```ts
  import { fields } from "@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder";
  ```

  Then merging it into your own custom field:

  ```ts
  fields: {
    text: {
      ...fields.text,
      labels: {
        singular: "Custom Text Field",
        plural: "Custom Text Fields",
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Email

This plugin relies on the [email configuration](https://payloadcms.com/docs/email/overview) defined in your `payload.init()`. It will read from your config and attempt to send your emails using the credentials provided.

## TypeScript

All types can be directly imported:

```js
import {
  PluginConfig,
  Form,
  FormSubmission,
  FieldsConfig,
  BeforePayment,
  BeforeEmail,
  HandlePayment,
  ...
} from "@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/types";
```

## Development

To actively develop or debug this plugin you can either work directly within the demo directory of this repo, or link your own project.

1. #### Internal Demo

   This repo includes a fully working, self-seeding instance of Payload that installs the plugin directly from the source code. This is the easiest way to get started. To spin up this demo, follow these steps:

   1. First clone the repo
   1. Then, `cd YOUR_PLUGIN_REPO && yarn && cd demo && cp env.example .env && yarn && yarn dev`
   1. Now open `http://localhost:3000/admin` in your browser
   1. Enter username `dev@payloadcms.com` and password `test`

   That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your demo. Keep in mind that the demo database is automatically seeded on every startup, any changes you make to the data get destroyed each time you reboot the app.

1. #### Linked Project

   You can alternatively link your own project to the source code:

   1. First clone the repo
   1. Then, `cd YOUR_PLUGIN_REPO && yarn && yarn build && yarn link`
   1. Now `cd` back into your own project and run, `yarn link @payloadcms/plugin-form-builder`
   1. If this plugin using React in any way, continue to the next step. Otherwise skip to step 7.
   1. From your own project, `cd node_modules/react && yarn link && cd ../react-dom && yarn link && cd ../../`
   1. Then, `cd YOUR_PLUGIN_REPO && yarn link react react-dom`

   All set! You can now boot up your own project as normal, and your local copy of the plugin source code will be used. Keep in mind that changes to the source code require a rebuild, `yarn build`.

   You might also need to alias these modules in your Webpack config. To do this, open your project's Payload config and add the following:

   ```ts
   import { buildConfig } from "payload/config";

   export default buildConfig({
     admin: {
       webpack: (config) => ({
         ...config,
         resolve: {
           ...config.resolve,
           alias: {
             ...config.resolve.alias,
             react: path.join(__dirname, "../node_modules/react"),
             "react-dom": path.join(__dirname, "../node_modules/react-dom"),
             payload: path.join(__dirname, "../node_modules/payload"),
             "@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder": path.join(
               __dirname,
               "../../payload/plugin-form-builder/src"
             ),
           },
         },
       }),
     },
   });
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Below are some common troubleshooting tips. To help other developers, please contribute to this section as you troubleshoot your own application.

### SendGrid 403 Forbidden Error

- If you are using [SendGrid Link Branding](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding) to remove the "via sendgrid.net" part of your email, you must also setup [Domain Authentication](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication). This means you can only send emails from an address on this domain — so the `from` addresses in your form submission emails **_cannot_** be anything other than `something@your_domain.com`. This means that from `{{email}}` will not work, but `website@your_domain.com` will. You can still send the form's email address in the body of the email.
